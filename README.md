# Perform-Network-Scanning-using-Various-Scanning-Tools
This repository provides a collection of network scanning tools and techniques used to identify active hosts, open ports, and services on a target network. It includes educational notes and examples of tools like Nmap, Netcat, Masscan, and others, offering practical insights into vulnerability assessments and network security audits.

Here’s a breakdown of each tool for educational purposes only, covering both usage and practical application.

### 1. **hping3**
   **Description**: `hping3` is a powerful packet crafting tool used for network scanning, testing, and security auditing. It can generate custom TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets for testing firewalls, network security, and discovering open ports.

   **Usage Example**:
   ```bash
   hping3 -S example.com -p 80
   ```

   **Explanation**: This command sends SYN packets to port 80 on `example.com` to check if the port is open. If it is, the target will respond with a SYN/ACK packet.
